# Thoughts and Insights
Even though I do have two blogs [WizardOfArc](https://wizardofarc.blogspot.com) and [AziCrawford](https://azicrawford.blogspot.com),
I don't blog a lot. For me, I think it works better to have these in a repo with thoughts placed in sections than a periodical/article style.  Plus - people can make PRs if they want ;)
