# Thoughts and Insights
I don't blog a lot. For me, I think it works better to have these in a repo with thoughts placed in sections than a periodical/article style.  

Plus - people can make PRs if they want ;)

That being said...

I do have two blogs:

 - [WizardOfArc](https://wizardofarc.blogspot.com)
 - [AziCrawford](https://azicrawford.blogspot.com)

_The careful observer may notice that these two names are anagrams of eachother_
