# Notes From Craft and Business of Songwriting

## Stages in creative process:
1. Preparation: gathering tools and establishment of form, theme, and style.
2. Incubation: The period of not trying - unconscious process
3. Illumination: The initial putput stage => suspend inner critic here.
4. Verification: Critical Stage -> observe song as product, objectively and detached. rewriting and poloshing...  Keeping stages 3 and 4 separate.


## Creativity Killers:
 - Evaluation: concern about ouyside approval will hinder your own creative impulse.
 - Surveillance: This can kill the creative phase - the working out phase... It can enhance _performance_ though.
 - Reward: when the reward comes, intrinsic motivation disappears, and with it creativity.
 - Competition - creative process is easier when you don't feel like you are competing.
 - Restricted Choice: limiting your options to acheiving your goal will hinder your creativity.


## Songwriters Consciousness: readiness to recognize a good song idea.
The only thing you can control is your readiness to catch inspiration.
 - Have a pad/pencil or recording device with you always.
 - Keep an Idea Notebook.
 - use code / shorthand.

## Find your own creative process.
- Deadline Writer: give yourself deadlines if this is your style.
- Total Focus Writer
- Scattered Writer: many pieces at once
- Project Writer


## Develop a Creative Ritual
Writer's block is a subconscious cue that something is unresolved and must be attended to.
 - try a different mode of perception
 - write - _anything_
 - Psych yourself out of pressure to do great work
 - Create an atmosphere
 - Find other places to write
 - forget writing altogether -> relax and have fun - diversion.
 - try stream of consciousness or problem solving techniques
 - play what you don't usually play.
 - collaborate with someone new.

## Stream of consciousness -> free associated blabber

 come up with an arbitrary premise or a set of parameter using the attributes:

 - Time Signature
 - Key
 - Melodic Mode
 - Number of Chords per section
 - Number of Tracks
 - Density of Instrumental Part
 - Mood
