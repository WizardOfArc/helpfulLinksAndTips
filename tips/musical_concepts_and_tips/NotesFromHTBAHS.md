# Notes from How to be a hit songwriter

## Four Questions:
 - Can you remember the simple melody and sing it back after one hearing?
 - Do you start to sing the song in the shower with realizing your singing it? Or hum it in the middle of your day?
 - Do your lyrics say something noone else has said before? 
 - Is your song completely original or is something borrowed?

## from chapter ten - quick and dirty way to write "a  hit song"
_seven steps_
 1. Sing the tune of a nursery rhyme: as you listen, jot down non-rhyming prose - just go with the feeling
 1. now write a silly, visual, non-rhyming lyric to the tune - no rhymes allowed here.
 1. write a list of silly titles that will fit the stresses of the first line of melody (7 syllables or less) - shoot for a total of 20 or 30 titles
 1. write a few _real_ titles with the same number of syllables as the silly ones.
 1. pick one of the real titles and write the story it tells in prose - no rhymes allowed here.
 1. using the story, write a non-rhyming lyric to the nursery rhyme melody - no rhymes here.
 1. now write the "real" lyrics - with story and rhymes
