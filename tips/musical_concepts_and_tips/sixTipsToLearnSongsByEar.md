# 6 Tips For Learning by Ear
## From Bryan Beller
1. Meter > learn the time signatures of the song (discover how to count it)
1. Pitch > what key is the song in
1. Rhythm > actual rhythm of the groove
1. Harmonic Context > what are the chords of each section > how do they relate to the key?
1. Song Form > overall song structure > when are the changes
1. Execution > taking all this stuff... executing/playing the song you learned by ear

## Azi's Order
_((wide to narrow))_
1. Song Form > number and order of sections
1. Meter > time signature(s) > and learn how many bars per section
1. Pitch > what key is the song in 
1. Rhythm > actual rhythm of the groove
1. Harmonic Context > what are the chords of each section > how do they relate to the key?
1. Execution > taking all this stuff... executing/playing the song you learned by ear
