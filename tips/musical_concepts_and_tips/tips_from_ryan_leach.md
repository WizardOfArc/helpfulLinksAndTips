    - so use Chaos to generate something to change
    - use 1D12 to select Key 1:C - 12:B
    - use any die to select Major or Minor: even-Major; odd-minor
        - use 1D6 if you want to get modal
    - use any die with system to select tempo
    - use any die with system to select time signature
    - use 1D12 to select first note
    - use 1D12 to select second note
- Selecting / Creating good Motif:

    - start simple - small 2-5 notes with some internal contrast
- Create (1-2 bar) Phrase from Motif
    - Azi's mathy formula: <strong>&phi; = m&#x2081; + c</strong>
        - <strong>&phi;</strong> is phrase
        - <strong>m&#x2081;</strong> is motif
        - <strong>c = m&#x2082; | m&#x2081;'</strong>
            - <strong>m&#x2082;</strong> is another motif
            - <strong>m&#x2081;'</strong> is a variation of <strong>m&#x2081;</strong>
