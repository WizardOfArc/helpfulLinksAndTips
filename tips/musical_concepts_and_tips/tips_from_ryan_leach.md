## The Tips
- It's easier to change what is there than to make something from nothing
    - so use Chaos to generate something to change
    - use 1D12 to select Key 1:C - 12:B
    - use any die to select Major or Minor: even-Major; odd-minor
        - use 1D6 if you want to get modal
    - use any die with system to select tempo
        - D20 times 10?
        - D6 % 3 with 1 slow, 2 medium, 0 fast?
    - use any die with system to select time signature
        - D20 for top number and 2^D4 for bottom number
    - use 1D12 to select first note
    - use 1D12 to select second note
- Selecting / Creating good Motif:
    - originally from Alan Belkin
    - start simple - small 2-5 notes with some internal contrast
- Create (1-2 bar) Phrase from Motif
    - Azi's mathy formula: <em><strong>&phi; = m&#x2081; &plus; c</strong></em>
        - <em><strong>&phi;</strong></em> is phrase
        - <em><strong>m&#x2081;</strong></em> is motif
        - <em><strong>c = m&#x2082; | m&#x2081;'</strong></em>
            - <em><strong>m&#x2082;</strong></em> is another motif
            - <em><strong>m&#x2081;'</strong></em> is a variation of <em><strong>m&#x2081;</strong></em>
- Thematic forms:
    - Period
        - for a sense of balance and continuation
        - <em><strong>P = &phi;&#x2081; &plus; &phi;&#x2082; &plus; &phi;&#x2081; &plus; C</strong></em>
            - <em><strong>P</strong></em> is Period
            - <em><strong>&phi;&#x2081;</strong></em> is first phrase
            - <em><strong>&phi;&#x2082;</strong></em> is contrasting phrase
            - <em><strong>C</strong></em> is cadence
    - Sentence
        - for a sense of motion and 'more'
        - <em><strong>S = &phi;&#x2081; &plus; &phi;&#x2081;' &plus; &phi;&#x2082; &plus; C</strong></em>
            - <em><strong>S</strong></em> is Sentence
            - <em><strong>&phi;&#x2081;'</strong></em> is sequenced or barely tweaked version of <em><strong>&phi;&#x2081;</strong></em>

- Finish writing your theme before listening back/editing
    - listening to just your first phrase before completing your theme will you give an innacurate sense of the flow of the theme, you'll have done extra repetitions - finish your theme first - then listen to it as a whole before editing.
