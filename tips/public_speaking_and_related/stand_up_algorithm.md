# Stand-Up Algorithm
## The Fifteen Secrets
 - A Joke requires 2 story lines.
 - Every part of a thing you imagine exists, but aren't directly perceiving is an assumption. If an assumption is made, then a joke is possible.
 - The aim of the reinterpretation is to shatter the assumption.
 - You explore a joke's possable paths by asking questions.
 - The jokes are in the details.
 - The sense of humor evolved as a means of coping with painful things.
 - Maintain a joke and routine file.
 - Comedians interpret jokes in ways that make people laugh.
 - How you rehearse is how you will perform.
 - A joke is a response to an experience.
 - Your job is to be funny.
 - When the audience is laughing - shut up.
 - If what you are doing isn't working - do ANYTHING else.
 - Most hecklers think they're making your show better.
 - Perform anywhere you can get in front of people.

## The Joke Prospector
1. Topic: Single Subject presenting something "wrong" - must not include opinion.
2. Association List: Specific things related to the topic.
3. Punch-Premise: A negative opinion bout something on the association list.
4. Set-up Premise: Opnion opposite to the punch-premise.  Directly opposite, or opposite by degree are both okay.
5. Writing Set-ups: Examples of the Set-up Premise (????)
6. "What am I assuming about this statement?"<sup>*</sup>
7. "What is the thing that caused me to make this assumption?" (connector)<sup>*</sup>
8. "Other than the target assumption, what other interpretations are there for my connector?"<sup>*</sup>
9. "Relative to the set-up, what specific situation could explain my reinterpretation?"<sup>*</sup>
10. "In addition to the set-up, what information is needed to communicate my 2nd story clearly?" (remember: brevity is levity. End the punch with the reveal and use sharp/hard consonants!)<sup>*</sup>

_**Once you have a set-up and a punch, you have a joke!**_

_<sup>*</sup>This method could generate many jokes. Steps 6-10 can be done with any statement, from anywhere, and anyone._
